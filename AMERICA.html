        <h3>    * SLOW-COOKER BRISKET *</h3>
    <img src="https://www.tasteofhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Texas-Style-Beef-Brisket_EXPS_THVP24_39534_MR_01_19_24_SlowCookerBrisket_2.jpg" alt="" height="400" width="400">
    <ul>
        Step 1: Season and marinate the brisket overnight
        In a large bowl or shallow dish, combine the Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, garlic, celery salt, pepper and, if desired, liquid smoke.
        Cut the brisket in half, then add it to the bowl and turn it to coat. Cover and refrigerate it overnight.

        Step 2: Slow-cook the brisket
        Transfer the beef to a 5- or 6-quart slow cooker. Add the broth and bay leaves. Cover and cook on low for six to eight hours, or until the meat is tender.
        
        Step 3: Make the barbecue sauce
        To make the sauce, in a small saucepan, saute the onion in oil until it's tender. Add garlic and cook for one minute longer. Stir in the remaining ingredients, and heat them through.

        Step 4: Flavor the barbecue sauce with cooking juices
        Remove the brisket from the slow cooker and discard the bay leaves. Place 1 cup of the cooking juices in a measuring cup and use a spoon to skim the fat. Discard the remaining 
        cooking juices. Add the reserved juices to the barbecue sauce.

        Step 5: Cook the brisket with the sauce
        Return the brisket to the slow cooker and top with the sauce mixture. Cover and cook on high for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
        
        Thinly slice the beef across the grain and serve it with the sauce.
    </ul>

    <ul>
        Step 1: Scoop the ice cream
        Place the three scoops of ice cream in a row in a dessert dish.

        Step 2: Arrange the banana halves
        Place one banana half on each side of the ice cream, letting the ice cream sit in the middle.

        Step 3: Add the toppings
        Top your banana split with the strawberries, pineapple, whipped cream, chopped peanuts, chocolate syrup and cherries. Serve the banana split immediately.
