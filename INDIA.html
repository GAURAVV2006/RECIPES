    <img src="https://www.archanaskitchen.com/images/archanaskitchen/Indian_Rice/Elumichai_Sadam_Lemon_Rice_Recipe_Nimbehannu_Chitraanna_Nimbu_Baath-1.jpg" alt="" height="400" width="400">
    <ul>
        To begin making the Lemon Rice Recipe (Elumichai Sadam/Chitranna), make sure you have some cooked rice ready. It helps using a day old rice as the grains will be separated out well.

        Keep the remaining ingredients handy, as this recipe will be made in a jiffy.

        Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan or kadai, add the mustard seeds, the urad dal and peanuts. Allow them to crackle and the dal and the peanuts to get roasted well until it gets a golden brown color. Do this on low to medium heat else they will get brown faster than you want them to and the peanuts will remain raw.

        Once the dal is golden brown and roasted, add the curry leaves, ginger, green chillies, turmeric powder and stir for a few seconds.

        Add the cooked rice, sprinkle some salt and give it a good stir until all the ingredients have combined well and the rice gets well coated. Turn the heat to low, cover the pan and allow the lemon rice to steam along with the seasonings for a couple of minutes.

        After a couple of minutes, squeeze the lemon juice and give the rice a good stir. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.

        Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped coriander leaves and serve.

        Serve the Lemon Rice (Elumichai Sadam/Chitranna) along with papad and tomato onion raita, or plain yogurt.

    <h3>   * GAZAR KA HALWA *</h3>

    <ul>
        To begin making the Gajjar Halwa Recipe, make sure you have all the ingredients ready and kept by the side. Grate the carrots using a hand grater or a food processor. 

        Heat 2 tablespoons ghee in a heavy bottomed pan; add the carrots and sauté for a few minutes until the carrots become lightly soft.

        Add the milk and turn the heat to medium high and allow the milk and carrot mixture to come to a boil. Once the milk and carrot mixture come to a boil, turn the heat to medium low and cook the gajjar halwa until entire milk is evaporated.

        This process will take close to 35 to 40 minutes.  Make sure you keep stirring the Gajjar halwa with a wooden spoon every time the milk froths up. Stirring also prevents the halwa from sticking to the bottom of the pan.

        Half way through this process, add the sugar and cook and stir until the entire milk is evaporated and until the Gajjar halwa mixture is thickened.

        When you notice a halwa like consistency, add the remaining ghee, cardamom powder, saffron and the sliced almonds. Simmer for another 5 minutes and turn off the heat.

        Transfer the Gajjar Halwa to a serving bowl and serve hot or cold for a delicious dessert after a meal.

        You can serve the Gajjar Halwa for the cold winter nights, topped with vanilla ice cream or on its own. Serve Gajjar Ka Halwa Recipe as a dessert after your delicious festive meal of Jodhpuri Aloo Ki Sabzi, Ajwain Puri and Boondi Raita.

    <ul>
        To begin making the Vada Pav with Spinach Corn Tikki Recipe, first get all the ingredients together. Prepare the Lahsun Chutney and keep aside.

        The next step is to make the Spinach Corn Tikki for the Vada Pav.

        Heat butter in a skillet pan and allow it to melt. Stir in the onions, garlic, ginger, green chillies and sauté for a couple of minutes till onions are soft and light golden in colour. 

        Finally stir in the spinach and cook the spinach and mint leaves for a few seconds until it wilts down and the moisture is almost evaporated. Add the mashed potatoes and steamed sweet corn, chaat masala and sauté for a couple of minutes and it becomes a thick firm tikki mixture.

        Allow the spinach corn tikki mixture to cool down. Shape the Spinach Corn Tikki mixture into round balls and keep aside.

        Coat each of the spinach corn tikki with bread crumbs.

        Preheat a skillet, melt the butter and pan fry the Spinach Corn Tikki's until they are browned and crisp on all sides.

        Take care not to turn the heat to high as this will not evenly cook the batter and you might just end up with over browned and uncooked portions. 

    </ul>
    <h3>   * PANEER MAKHANI *</h3>
    <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.lbI1YQfkeM5Dssp4jCtgFAHaEt&pid=Api&P=0&h=180.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400">
    <ol>
        To begin making the Paneer Makhani Recipe, make sure you have the Home Made Paneer and the Tomato Puree ready. Keep them aside.

        In the next step, make a smooth paste of the onion, ginger and garlic in a food grinder. 
        
        Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan, add a teaspoon of oil. Add the onion paste mixture and saute it on medium heat until the raw smell goes away. This would take about 4 minutes approximately.
        
        Next add the turmeric powder, cumin powder, cardamom powder, garam masala powder and stir-fry it along with the masala for about 2 minutes. This process of sauteing the masala helps the onions loose its raw smell faster.
        
        Once, well sauteed, add the tomato puree and simmer until the tomato puree begins to start bubbling and boiling.
        
        Once it does, stir in the cream, chilli powder, salt, kasuri methi and paneer. Give the paneer makhani a good stir and simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes.
        
        After about 3 minutes of simmering, check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste. Turn off the heat and transfer the paneer makhani to a serving bowl.
        
        Serve the Paneer Makhani with an Indian bread of your choice for a cozy and quick weeknight dinner.
